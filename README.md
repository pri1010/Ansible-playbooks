### Introduction

This repository houses Ansible playbooks tailored to streamline our infrastructure management tasks. Ansible offers a simple, yet powerful, automation solution to deploy, configure, and manage servers. These playbooks are designed to automate repetitive tasks, reduce human error, and enhance operational efficiency.

### Prerequisites

Before using these playbooks, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **Ansible**: Install Ansible on the system from which you intend to execute the playbooks. Refer to the official [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) for installation instructions.
- **Inventory File**: Create an inventory file (`inventory.ini`) containing the list of hosts you want to manage with Ansible. Refer to Ansible's [inventory documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html) for guidance.
- **SSH Access**: Ensure SSH access is enabled and configured on the target hosts. Ansible uses SSH to connect and execute commands remotely.

### Usage

To use these playbooks:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-organization/Ansible-playbooks.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository:

    ```bash
    cd Ansible-playbooks
    ```

3. Review the playbook files in the `playbooks` directory and edit them as needed to match your environment.

4. Execute the desired playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:
   
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
    ```

    Replace `inventory.ini` with your inventory file and `playbook.yml` with the playbook you want to execute.
