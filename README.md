### Introduction

This repository houses Ansible playbooks tailored to streamline our infrastructure management tasks. Ansible offers a simple, yet powerful, automation solution to deploy, configure, and manage servers. These playbooks are designed to automate repetitive tasks, reduce human error, and enhance operational efficiency.

### Prerequisites

Before using these playbooks, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- **Ansible**: Install Ansible on the system from which you intend to execute the playbooks. Refer to the official [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) for installation instructions.
- **Inventory File**: Create an inventory file (`inventory.ini`) containing the list of hosts you want to manage with Ansible. Refer to Ansible's [inventory documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html) for guidance.
